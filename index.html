	<p>Welcome to my SINY March 2014 class site for the Product and Design Track <p>
	
	<p>I joined this program to develop my artistic side in the form of UI/UX design as well as my front-end development skills in order to become a well-rounded highly productive member of a hip and cool startup in NYC. </p>

	<p>My professional background is in software development project management and business analysis. I’ve worked with several start-ups and have always felt ‘at home’ in those environments regardless of what country I was working in. In addition to the US, I have worked in Italy, Switzerland and the UK. I’m now looking to work in New York. </p>

	<p>As for as my educational background, I have a BS CIS & a MS in Technology Management from Denver University. As far as professional certifications I am a Prince 2 Practitioner and Certified Scrum Master. </p>
